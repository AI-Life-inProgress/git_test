          LEARNING TO CODE: THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING INSPIRATION & HOLDING ON TIGHT FOR THE RIDE

I'll be honest I've tried learning to code in the past and it didn't go so well, hence why I am writing this.
(-_-)

Oh, I wanted to learn it last time but I think I was just looking in the wrong places to learn and I kept making excuses as to why I was not a suitable candidate for such a task.
I considered myself not smart enough, it's only for people with a high IQ. **WRONG!**
Yeah sure intelligence helps but it will only get you so far in the game of life.

This stuff is **HARD!** It's meant to be **HARD**, nothing in life worth obtaining is easy! 

Well, I am back and this time I seriously want to become a **Front-end Developer.** I think this could be an exciting career path. It is very different to what I have ever done and it challenges me. So, here if anyone is interested in having some inspiration on the side, I will be updating on this page with what I find on the web. **Hope it encourages you all! Don't give up!**

``1. "The reason that most people fail to learn programming and become developers is the same reason that most people fail to learn other things like, playing the piano, speaking French etc. The reality once the excitement is over is that it takes a lot of time, a lot of effort and huge amounts of determination. Most people don't have that and they give up as soon as things get difficult." ~anonymous Internet``

``2. "Coding is not too different than things you already know, it's just a language used to express your understanding of how to solve a problem, the first step is to "imagine" the steps of solving the problem in your head, you can do that using "common sense" and step by step procedures of breaking down complex parts into smaller ones, after that what is left is learning what keys to press on your keyboard to "translate" the solution into computer language.
You will NEVER be able to code something that you didn't already solve in your head."  ~anonymous Internet``
