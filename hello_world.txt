"The reason that most people fail to learn programming and become developers is the same reason that most people fail to learn other things like, playing the piano, speaking French etc. The reality once the excitement is over is that it takes a lot of time, a lot of effort and huge amounts of determination. Most people don't have that and they give up as soon as things get difficult."

"Coding is not too different than things you already know, it's just a language used to express your understanding of how to solve a problem, the first step is to "imagine" the steps of solving the problem in your head, you can do that using "common sense" and step by step procedures of breaking down a complex parts into smaller ones, after that what is left is learning what keys to press on your keyboard to "translate" the solution into computer language.
you will NEVER be able to code something that you didn't solved in your head firsthand."
