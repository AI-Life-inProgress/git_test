Hello Odin!

# This is a MARKDOWN Language

As you can see it is still considered a Markup Language as it can do something a little more exciting than an average .txt file on the computer.
To make a markdown file we just add the extension: .md at the end

We can add bold titles just like the HTML markup language. There are some similarities here.

# A first-level **heading**
## A second-level *heading*
### A third-***level*** heading


~~I am still text that you can read~~

<sub>And I am Subscript text, hence why I am rather small</sub>

v<sup>And I am Superscript text!</sup>

> Text that is a quote

```
I can be used for many things and I am inside back-ticks!
